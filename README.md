# Retail Sales Predictor

This project focuses on building predictive models for daily retail store sales using historical data and store metadata. It is part of a data mining course at K.N.Toosi University of Technology.

## 📊 Objective
To forecast daily sales based on store characteristics, promotional campaigns, and temporal features using regression models.

## 🧰 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering from date and store attributes
- Train-test split based on chronological order
- Model training using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Feature importance analysis

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Sales data with daily records per store
- Store metadata including retail type, stock variety, and promotional history

## 🧪 Evaluation
Models are evaluated on their ability to extrapolate future sales using RMSE and R² metrics.

## 📌 Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Outcome
Insights into which features most influence sales and how well models generalize to unseen dates.
